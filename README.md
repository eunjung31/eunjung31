## Hi there! 👋

- 😄 I'm Eunjung /ɨn-d͡ʒʌŋ/!
- 💬 Computational Linguist, and Speech Scientist, particularly interested in phonetics and phonology.
- 🤔 My research has focused on technologies for pathological speech (mainly motor speech disorders), and occasionally on non-native speech, particularly in the areas of automatic assessment and ASR.
- 💡 My core interest lies in the cross-lingual and multilingual aspects of these applications.
- 📝 Currently learning as a Visiting scholar @ ChangeLing lab, Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University
- 👩‍🎓 Former Ph.D. & Masters student @ Spoken Language Processing lab, Linguistics, Seoul National University
- 🌱 Former Undergrad student @ Korean Language and Literature & Psychology (double major), Yonsei University
- ❤️ My passion comes from making a better world where everyone can convey their messages to the world.
- 📌 I believe linguistic knowledge can be leveraged to enhance speech technologies for individuals.
